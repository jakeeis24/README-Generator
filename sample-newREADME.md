# THIS IS THE SAMPLE README

After this paragraph, everything below was generated using the command line application contained in this repository. I have included screenshots in the sample_images file to show the prompts along with the responses. This was also the README generated during my walkthrough video. There are some typos but I left them in there to show that everything matches. Thanks!
